// 1. Is this just a clever way of doing things?
//    - No, it is about writing terse code: Readable and performant


// 2. Can it co-exist with my OO goodness?
//    - Yes

// 3. How can I think more functionally?
//    - Practice!
//    - By using them more and more in your day-to-day work, 
//       and getting feedback from others whether it really makes sense!

// 4. Any resources?
//    - Practice: 4clojure, codewars, exercism, project euler...
//    - Theory: Living Clojure, Learn You a Haskell..
